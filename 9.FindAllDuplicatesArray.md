# Finding Duplicates in an Array (LeetCode 442)

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all elements appear once or twice, return **all** the elements that appear **twice**.

### Example:
```js
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]
```

## ✨ Intuition
Instead of using extra space like a Set or Map to track duplicates, we can use the input array itself to store metadata.

The key idea is:
- All elements are in the range `1` to `n`, so each value `v` can be mapped to an index `v - 1`.
- We negate the number at index `v - 1` the first time we see `v`.
- If we find that index already negative, it means we've seen `v` before (it's a duplicate).

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Approach

1. Initialize an empty result array.
2. Traverse each number in the array:
   - Take the absolute value `val = Math.abs(num)`.
   - Check the sign of `nums[val - 1]`.
     - If it is **positive**, mark it by negating it.
     - If it is **negative**, it means we've seen it before. So, push `val` to the result.
3. Return the result.

## ✅ Code (JavaScript)
```js
var findDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let index = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
        if (nums[index] < 0) {
            result.push(index + 1);
        } else {
            nums[index] = -nums[index];
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

## 🧵 Dry Run Example

Input: `[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`

- i = 0, nums[3] = 7 → Mark nums[3] as -7
- i = 1, nums[2] = 2 → Mark nums[2] as -2
- i = 2, nums[1] = 3 → Mark nums[1] as -3
- i = 3, nums[6] = 2 → Mark nums[6] as -2
- i = 4, nums[7] = 1 → Mark nums[7] as -1
- i = 5, nums[1] is negative → 2 is a duplicate
- i = 6, nums[2] is negative → 3 is a duplicate
- i = 7, nums[0] = 4 → Mark nums[0] as -4

Output: `[2, 3]`

## ⌛ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)` ✔
- **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)` ✔ (excluding output)

---

## 🔐 Key Insight
- Since numbers are in the range `1 to n`, the index mapping trick (value → index) works perfectly.
- Using signs (positive/negative) as markers is a clever and efficient in-place strategy.

---

## 🔍 Is this truly O(1) space?
Yes, because:
- We're not using Sets, Maps, or any extra array.
- We reuse the input array for marking.
- The result array is **output space** and not counted in auxiliary space.

---

## 📅 When to Use This Technique
Use this when:
- Elements are within a known range (`1 to n`).
- You're allowed to **modify** the input array.
- You want a space-efficient solution.
