# 🎯 Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array (in non-decreasing order) and you need to:

- Remove duplicates in-place (without using extra space).
- Return the length of the modified array that contains only unique elements.
- The elements beyond the modified length don’t matter.

## 🧠 Goal/Output:

✅ Modify the array such that:

- All unique elements are in the left part of the array.
- Return the count (k) of unique elements.

## 📝 Example:

```javascript
Input: arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Return: 3

## 🧐 Step-by-Step Intuition
1️⃣ Identify Key Observations:
The array is already sorted.

Duplicates will appear next to each other.

To remove duplicates, we just need to move unique elements to the left of the array.

2️⃣ Understand the Two-Pointer Approach:
✅ Pointer i: Keeps track of the position of the last unique element. ✅ Pointer j: Iterates through the array to find new unique elements.

💡 Idea:
Start with i = 0 (first unique element).

Traverse the array using j starting from j = 1.

Whenever arr[i] !== arr[j], it means we found a new unique element.

Move i one step ahead.

Place the new unique element at position i.

Continue this process until the end.

🔥 Visualizing the Process:
Consider the array:
ini
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
👉 Initial State:

i = 0, j = 1
arr[i] = 1, arr[j] = 1 (duplicate, ignore)
👉 Move j forward:

i = 0, j = 2
arr[i] = 1, arr[j] = 2 (new element found!)
=> Move `i` to 1
=> arr[1] = 2
👉 Move j forward:

i = 1, j = 3
arr[i] = 2, arr[j] = 2 (duplicate, ignore)
👉 Move j forward:

i = 1, j = 5
arr[i] = 2, arr[j] = 3 (new element found!)
=> Move `i` to 2
=> arr[2] = 3
👉 End of array reached:

i + 1 = 3 (Length of the modified array)
Modified array: [1, 2, 3]
📝 Final Code (with Explanation):
javascript
function removeDuplicates(arr) {
  let i = 0; // Initial position for unique elements

  for (let j = 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
    // If a new unique element is found
    if (arr[i] !== arr[j]) {
      i++; // Move `i` to next position
      arr[i] = arr[j]; // Store the new unique element
    }
  }

  // `i + 1` gives the length of the modified array
  return i + 1;
}
🧪 Test Cases:
javascript
const arr1 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3];
console.log(removeDuplicates(arr1)); // Output: 3 (Modified array: [1, 2, 3])

const arr2 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
console.log(removeDuplicates(arr2)); // Output: 1 (Modified array: [1])

const arr3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(removeDuplicates(arr3)); // Output: 5 (No duplicates, same array)

const arr4 = [];
console.log(removeDuplicates(arr4)); // Output: 0 (Empty array)

const arr5 = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8];
console.log(removeDuplicates(arr5)); // Output: 4 (Modified array: [5, 6, 7, 8])
⚡️ Time and Space Complexity:
🕒 Time Complexity: O(n) Single pass through the array.

💾 Space Complexity: O(1) Modifying the array in place without extra space.

🤔 Why This Approach Works:
Since the array is sorted, all duplicates are adjacent.

We just need to move the unique elements to the left, which makes this a perfect case for the two-pointer approach.

🧠 Key Takeaways:
✅ You’re modifying the array in place using two pointers. ✅ Moving elements only when a unique element is found optimizes the process. ✅ The final array only contains unique elements up to index i.
