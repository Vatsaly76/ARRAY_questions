# 🍌 Koko Eating Bananas - Binary Search Approach

## 📘 Problem Statement

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i-th` pile has `arr[i]` bananas. The guards allow her to eat only one pile per hour. She can choose an integer speed `k` (bananas per hour) and eats exactly `k` bananas from a pile per hour. If the pile has less than `k`, she eats the whole pile.

Return the minimum integer speed `k` such that she can eat all bananas within `h` hours.

---

## 🔍 Key Insight

We can approach this problem using Binary Search on the possible range of `k` (from 1 to the largest pile). For each candidate speed `mid`, we simulate if Koko can eat all the bananas in `h` hours or not.

---

## 💡 Strategy: Binary Search

* **Search Space**: `k` ranges from `1` to `max(arr)`
* **Condition**: Check if a certain speed `mid` lets Koko eat all the bananas within `h` hours.
* **Objective**: Find the minimum speed `k` for which the condition is satisfied.

---

## ✅ Final Code

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} h
 * @return {number}
 */
var minEatingSpeed = function (arr, h) {
    let l = 1, r = Math.max(...arr), ans = -1;
    while (l <= r) {
        let mid = Math.floor((l + r) / 2);
        if (isPossible(arr, h, mid)) {
            ans = mid;
            r = mid - 1;
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
};

var isPossible = function (arr, h, mid) {
    let totalhours = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        totalhours += Math.ceil(arr[i] / mid);
    }
    return totalhours <= h;
};
```

## 📌 Relation to Book Allocation Problem

### Book Allocation:

Given `n` books with pages and `k` students, allocate books such that:

* Each student gets contiguous books
* Minimum number of maximum pages assigned to any student

**Function Logic for Book Allocation**:

```js
isValid(arr, n, k, mid) {
    let stu = 1, pages = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > mid) return false;
        else if (pages + arr[i] <= mid) {
            pages += arr[i];
        } else {
            stu++;
            pages = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return stu <= k;
}
```

### 🍌 Koko Eating Analogy:

* **Books** → Banana piles
* **Pages per book** → Bananas per pile
* **Students** → Hours
* **Max pages per student** → Max bananas per hour (speed `k`)

## 🔎 Example

**Input:** `arr = [3, 6, 7, 11]`, `h = 8`

### Dry Run:

* Try `k = 4`: `⌈3/4⌉ + ⌈6/4⌉ + ⌈7/4⌉ + ⌈11/4⌉ = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8` hours ✅
* Try `k = 3`: `⌈3/3⌉ + ⌈6/3⌉ + ⌈7/3⌉ + ⌈11/3⌉ = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` hours ❌

So, minimum `k = 4`

---

## 🎯 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log(max(arr)))`
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (ignoring input storage)

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

This is a classic binary search on the **answer space**, not the array itself. Always ask:

> Can I define a function `f(x)` that tells me if `x` is a valid answer?
