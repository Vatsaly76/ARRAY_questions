# Game of Life - Step-by-Step Explanation

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of cells (either alive or dead), update the board according to the following rules:

### Rules:
1. **Live cell with <2 live neighbors** dies (underpopulation).
2. **Live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors** lives.
3. **Live cell with >3 live neighbors** dies (overpopulation).
4. **Dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors** becomes alive (reproduction).

---

## Step-by-Step Plan
We need to update the board **in-place** so that the changes donâ€™t affect neighbor calculations. To do this, we use **markers**:
- `1` = alive, `0` = dead
- Use `2` = alive â†’ dead
- Use `3` = dead â†’ alive

---

## Visual Example Input:
```
Initial Board:
[             
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0]
]
```

Check the middle cell (1, 1):
- It has 3 live neighbors: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0)
- It **survives** (rule 2)

---

## Step 1: Count Live Neighbors
```js
function countLiveNeighbors(board, r, c) {
  let live = 0;
  const directions = [
    [0, 1], [1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1],
    [1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1], [-1, 1]
  ];

  for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
    let nr = r + dr;
    let nc = c + dc;
    if (nr >= 0 && nr < board.length && nc >= 0 && nc < board[0].length) {
      if (board[nr][nc] === 1 || board[nr][nc] === 2) {
        live++;
      }
    }
  }
  return live;
}
```

### Explanation of Variables:
- `r, c`: current cell position
- `live`: count of live neighbors
- `directions`: all 8 directions around the cell
- `board[nr][nc] === 1 || 2`: current or previously live

### Example (1,1):
```
[0, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 1]  -> (1,1) has 3 live neighbors
[1, 0, 0]
```

## Step 2: Apply Rules Using Markers
```js
for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
    let liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(board, i, j);

    if (board[i][j] === 1 && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3)) {
      board[i][j] = 2; // alive -> dead
    }
    if (board[i][j] === 0 && liveNeighbors === 3) {
      board[i][j] = 3; // dead -> alive
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 3: Final Conversion
```js
for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
    if (board[i][j] === 2) board[i][j] = 0; // was alive, now dead
    if (board[i][j] === 3) board[i][j] = 1; // was dead, now alive
  }
}
```

---

## âœ… Final Code
```js
var gameOfLife = function(board) {
  function countLiveNeighbors(board, r, c) {
    let live = 0;
    const directions = [
      [0, 1], [1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1],
      [1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1], [-1, 1]
    ];
    for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
      let nr = r + dr;
      let nc = c + dc;
      if (nr >= 0 && nr < board.length && nc >= 0 && nc < board[0].length) {
        if (board[nr][nc] === 1 || board[nr][nc] === 2) live++;
      }
    }
    return live;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
      let liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(board, i, j);
      if (board[i][j] === 1 && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3)) {
        board[i][j] = 2;
      }
      if (board[i][j] === 0 && liveNeighbors === 3) {
        board[i][j] = 3;
      }
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] === 2) board[i][j] = 0;
      if (board[i][j] === 3) board[i][j] = 1;
    }
  }
};
```

## Summary
- Count live neighbors carefully.
- Use extra markers (2 & 3) to handle in-place transitions.
- Final pass to clean up and restore proper 0/1 values.

This method is **in-place, clean, and efficient**.
