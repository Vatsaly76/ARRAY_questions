# 📚 Rotate an Array by d Elements in Counter-Clockwise Direction

## 🎯 Goal
Rotate an array **`arr`** by `d` elements to the left (counter-clockwise).

---

## 🧠 Basic Idea
To rotate an array to the left by `d` positions, we want to:
- Move the first `d` elements to the end.
- Shift the remaining elements to the left.

### Example:
```javascript
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
d = 2
```
Expected result:
```
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

## 🔄 Reversal Algorithm Intuition
Instead of shifting elements one by one (which would take O(n * d) time), we use **three reversals** to achieve the rotation in linear time.

### 📚 Steps:

### Step 1: Reverse the first `d` elements
- Reverse the subarray from index `0` to `d-1`.
```javascript
reverse(arr, 0, d - 1);
```
- For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `d = 2`:
    - Reverse `[1, 2]` → becomes `[2, 1]`

✅ After Step 1:
```
arr = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

### Step 2: Reverse the remaining elements
- Reverse the subarray from index `d` to `n-1`.
```javascript
reverse(arr, d, arr.length - 1);
```
- Reverse `[3, 4, 5]` → becomes `[5, 4, 3]`

✅ After Step 2:
```
arr = [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]
```

---

### Step 3: Reverse the entire array
- Reverse the entire array from `0` to `n-1`.
```javascript
reverse(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
```
- Reverse `[2, 1, 5, 4, 3]` → becomes `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

✅ After Step 3:
```
arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

## 📝 Complete Code
```javascript
class Solution {
    // Function to rotate an array by d elements in counter-clockwise direction.
    rotateArr(arr, d) {
        d = d % arr.length;  // Handle large d values
        
        reverse(arr, 0, d - 1);
        reverse(arr, d, arr.length - 1);
        reverse(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
        
        function reverse(arr, i, j) {
            while (i < j) {
                let temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }

        return arr;
    }
}
```

## 📚 Why This Works
### 💡 Key Concept
- **Reversing a part of the array "flips" it.**
- By reversing segments and then reversing the whole array, we effectively rotate the elements by `d` positions.

### 🔥 Visual Breakdown
```
Original:    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 1:      [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]   (reverse first d)
Step 2:      [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]   (reverse remaining)
Step 3:      [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]   (reverse all)
```

## ⏱️ Time Complexity
- Each reverse operation takes **O(n)** in the worst case.
- Since there are **3 reversals**, the total time complexity is:
```
O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
```

## 💾 Space Complexity
- The space used is **O(1)** because everything happens **in-place**. No extra space is needed.

---

## 🧩 Edge Case Handling
1. **If `d == 0`:**
   No rotation needed, return the array as-is.

2. **If `d > arr.length`:**
   - We do `d % arr.length` to handle large `d` values.
   - Example:
   ```
   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   d = 7 → d % 5 = 2
   ```
   So, we rotate by `2` positions.

3. **If array length is 1:**
   No rotation happens as there's only one element.

---

## 🎉 Conclusion
This algorithm is efficient and clever because:
- Instead of moving each element one by one (which takes O(n * d) time), it rotates the array in **linear time** using only 3 reverse operations. 🚀
