# Two Sum - Optimal Solution (Using Hash Map)

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Example:**

```js
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1] // because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

## 💡 Intuition

- A brute-force approach uses two loops to check all pairs – but it has `O(n^2)` time complexity.
- Instead, we can use a **hash map** to store the required complement for each element.
- While traversing the array, check if the current number is already in the hash map.
- If it is, return the stored index and the current index.

---

## ✅ Steps

1. Initialize an empty map `map`.
2. Iterate over the array `nums` with index `i`.
3. For each element:
   - Compute the complement `target - nums[i]`.
   - Check if this complement exists in the map.
   - If yes → return `[map.get(complement), i]`.
   - If not → store `nums[i]` with its index in the map.

## 🧠 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing elements in the map

## ✅ Code (Optimal - JavaScript)

```js
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    let map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i); // store current value and its index
    }
};
```

---

## 🔁 Example Dry Run

```js
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Iteration 1:
i = 0, nums[i] = 2
complement = 9 - 2 = 7
map = { 2: 0 }

Iteration 2:
i = 1, nums[i] = 7
complement = 9 - 7 = 2
map has 2 → return [0, 1]
```

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Always check for opportunities to use maps/sets for quick lookup.
- If asked to find a pair in an array that meets a condition → hash map is often a good hint.
- Brute-force is okay to start, but always look for optimizations!

## 🧩 Why Do We Use `map.set(nums[i], i)`?

This line is **crucial**. It stores the current number as a key and its index as the value in the map.

### 🔄 Purpose:
It helps to **quickly look up** if the *complement* exists in the map for future elements.

### 🧪 Example:
```js
nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
```

- i = 0 → nums[0] = 3 → complement = 3 → not in map → `map.set(3, 0)`
- i = 1 → nums[1] = 2 → complement = 4 → not in map → `map.set(2, 1)`
- i = 2 → nums[2] = 4 → complement = 2 → found in map → return `[1, 2]`

### 💡 Conclusion:
Storing each number and its index allows instant retrieval of a matching pair when the complement appears later in the array.
